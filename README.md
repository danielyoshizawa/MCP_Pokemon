# MCP_Pokemon

A Pokemon-focused implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless integration between Pokemon data and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About

This project implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources. In this specific implementation, we focus on creating a bridge between Pokemon-related data and LLMs, allowing for rich interactions and data analysis in the Pokemon domain.

## Features (Planned)

- Implementation of MCP specification for Pokemon data
- RESTful API for Pokemon information retrieval
- Seamless integration with various LLM models
- Structured data format for Pokemon characteristics
- Real-time context handling for Pokemon-related queries

## Technical Stack

- Python implementation of MCP
- FastAPI for the REST interface
- Integration with PokeAPI for base Pokemon data
- Support for various LLM providers
